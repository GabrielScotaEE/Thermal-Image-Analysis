# Thermal-Image-Analysis
## This project aims to extract data from thermal images

- A very common question on this topic is how to know the specific temperature of a respective color. Often the thermal camera in use does not have free software to translate colors to temperatures.
- One way to do this is to compare pixel by pixel in the image with the available colorbar in the image. You can see an exemple here: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62107454/mapping-pixel-value-to-temperature-value-on-a-thermal-image).

- To do the above-mentioned you can follow the comments in all `.py` archives, starting from `tgMain.py`.
